# 1. Rediscovering Simplicity

When you were new to programming you wrote simple code. Although you may not have appreciated it at the time, this was a great strength. Since then, you’ve learned new skills, tackled harder problems, and produced increasingly complex solutions. Experience has taught you that most code will someday change, and you’ve begun to craft it in anticipation of that day. Complexity seems both natural and inevitable.

Where you once optimized code for understandability, you now focus on its changeability. Your code is less concrete but more abstract—you’ve made it initially harder to understand in hopes that it will ultimately be easier to maintain.

The basic promise of Object-Oriented Design (OOD):  if you’re willing to accept increases in the complexity of your code along some dimensions, you’ll be rewarded with decreases in complexity along others. 

OOD doesn’t claim to be free; it merely asserts that its benefits outweigh its costs.

Design decisions inevitably involve trade-offs. There’s always a cost. For example, if you’ve duplicated a bit of code in many places, the Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle tells you to extract the duplication into a single common method and then invoke this new method in place of the old code.

DRY is a great idea, but that doesn’t mean it’s free. The price you pay for DRYing out code is that the invoker of the new method no longer knows the result, only the message it should send. If you’re willing to pay this price, that is, you are willing to be ignorant of the actual behavior, the reward you reap is that when the behavior changes, you need alter your code in only one place. The argument that OOD makes is that this bargain will save you money.

Each of these design choices has costs, and it only makes sense to pay these costs if you also accrue some offsetting benefits. Design is thus about picking the right abstractions. If you choose well, your code will be expressive, understandable and flexible, and everyone will love both it and you. However, if you get the abstractions wrong, your code will be convoluted, confusing, and costly, and your programming peers will hate you.

Unfortunately, abstractions are hard, and even with the best of intentions, it’s easy to get them wrong. 

Well-meaning programmers tend to over-anticipate abstractions, inferring them prematurely from incomplete information. Early abstractions are often not quite right, and therefore they create a catch-22.

You should not reach for abstractions, but instead, you should resist them until they absolutely insist upon being created.


## Tests

All tests ontains three parts:

- **Setup** Create the specific environment required for the test. 
- **Do** Perform the action to be tested.
- **Verify** Confirm the result is as expected.


## Understanding Transformations

In the "Transformation Priority Premise" (a blog post that you are urged to scan), Martin defines transformations as "simple operations that change the behavior of code." Not only does he describe a set of transformations that move code from more specific to more generic, he arranges these transformations in "priority" order, from simpler to more complex. 

He asserts that **when a problem can be solved with any one of several transformations, the transformation with the highest priority is simplest and therefore best.**


As was stated in the previous section, as tests get more specific, code should become more generic. Code becomes more generic by becoming more abstract. 

One way to make code more abstract is to DRY it out, that is, to extract duplicate bits of code into a single method, to give that method a name, and then to refer to the code by this new name. DRYing out code removes the duplication and thus reduces its overall size.

As you’ve seen, when working towards Shameless Green, it makes sense sometimes to eliminate duplication and other times to retain it. The Shameless Green solution is optimized to be straightforward and intention-revealing, and it doesn’t much concern itself with changeability or future maintenance. The goal is to use green to maximize your understanding of the problem and to unearth all available information before committing to abstractions.


## Case(Switch) vs If/Else

Use of if / elsif implies that each subsequent condition varies in a meaningful way. Because elsif is often used to test wildly different conditions, future readers will feel obliged to closely
examine each one. 

In contrast, use of case implies that every condition checks for equality against an explicit value. While it’s true that the when clause supports more complicated operations, the form above is most common and is the one your readers will expect. Readers of case statements expect conditions to be fundamentally the same.

## The Horizontal Path

Following the horizontal path means writing code to produce every kind of verse before diverging onto tangents to DRY out small bits of code that the verses have in common. The goal is to quickly maximize the number of whole examples before extracting abstractions from their parts.


Code longs to be as ignorant as possible. 


In Chapter 28 of Test-Driven Development by Example, Kent Beck describes different ways to make tests pass. Three of his "Green Bar Patterns" are:

- Fake It ("Til You Make It") 
- Obvious Implementation 
- Triangulate



## SOLID Design Principles

The SOLID acronym was coined by Michael Feathers and popularized by Robert Martin. Each letter stands for a well-known principle in object-oriented design. Here’s a formal definition of each one:

### S - Single Responsibility
The methods in a class should be cohesive around a single purpose.

### O - Open-Closed
Objects should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

### L - Liskov Substitution
Subclasses should be substitutable for their superclasses.

### I - Interface Segregation
Objects should not be forced to depend on methods they don’t use.

### D - Dependency Inversion
Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.

## Open Principle

The "open" principle says that you should not conflate the process of moving code around, of refactoring, with the act of adding new features. You should instead separate these two operations. When faced with a new requirement, first rearrange the existing code such that it’s open to the new feature, and once that’s complete, then add the new code.


## 3.3. Recognizing Code Smells

The trick to successfully improving code that contains many flaws is to isolate and correct them one at a time. In his Refactoring book, Martin Fowler identifies and names many common flaws, and provides refactoring recipes to fix them. Chapter 3  calls the flaws "code smells." Thanks to Fowler’s book, if you can identify a smell within code, you can look up the curative refactoring, and apply that refactoring to remove the flaw.

Therefore, the current task is to refactor the verse method to remove the duplication, in hope and expectation that the resulting code will be more open to the six-pack requirement.

Before undertaking this refactoring, it must be admitted that there is no direct connection between removing the duplication, and succeeding in making the code open to the six-pack requirement. That, however, is the beauty of this technique. You don’t have to know how to solve the whole problem in advance. The plan is to nibble away, one code smell at a time, in faith that the path to openness will be revealed.

Tests are the wall at your back. Successful refactorings lean on green. Therefore, you should never change tests during a refactoring. If your tests are flawed such that they interfere with refactoring, improve them first, and then refactor.

Considered from a higher viewpoint, each variant is merely a verse in the song; in that sense they are all the same. Underlying each concrete variant is a generalized verse abstraction. If you could find this abstraction, you could use it to reduce the four-branch case statement to a single line of code.

The good news is that you don’t have to be able to see the abstraction in advance. You can find it by iteratively applying a small set of simple rules. These rules are known as "Flocking Rules", and are as follows:

#### Flocking Rules

1. Select the things that are most alike.
2. Find the smallest difference between them.
3. Make the simplest change that will remove that difference.

Changes to code can be subdivided into four distinct steps:

1. parse the new code
2. parse and execute it
3. parse, execute and use its result
4. delete unused code

As you’re following the rules:

1. In general, change only one line at a time. 
2. Run the tests after every change.
3. If you go red, undo and make a better change.

## 3.7.1. Focusing on Difference

When examining complicated problems, the eye is first drawn towards sameness. However, despite the fact that sameness is easier to identify, difference is more useful because it has more meaning. DRYing out sameness has some value, but DRYing out difference has more.


### Naming the 'bottles' part of the sentence

It might seem as if "Unit" would be a good header. Although it’s true that every example is some kind of unit, there are two problems with this name. First, it’s too abstract. Unit is not one level of abstraction higher than the examples—it’s many. There are plenty of good naming alternatives on the continuum between "bottle" and "unit." Next, unit is not in the language of the domain. The name you choose will be the name you use in conversations with your customers. Naming things after domain concepts improves communication between you and the folks who pay the bills. Only good can come of this.

If you were to ask your users, "What kind of thing is a bottle?," they wouldn’t reply "It’s a unit." Instead
they might call it the container. In the context of "99 Bottles," container is a good name for this concept. Container is meaningful, understandable, and unambiguous.
